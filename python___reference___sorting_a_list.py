'Sorting A List'

'Although a listâ€™s elements are always ordered by position, it is possible 
'to impose a natural ordering on them as well. In other words, you can 
'arrange some elements in numeric or alphabetical order. A list of numbers 
'in ascending order and a list of names in alphabetical order are sorted 
'lists. When the elements can be related by comparing them for less than 
'and greater than as well as equality, they can be sorted. The list 
'method sort mutates a list by arranging its elements in ascending order. 
'Here is an example of its use:'

>>>example = [4, 2, 10, 8]
>>>example
[4, 2, 10, 8]
>>>example.sort()
>>>example
[2, 4, 8, 10]
