/* Properties for positioning elements

position                    A keyword that determines how an element is positioned. 
                                See the table below for possible values.
top, bottom, left, right    For absolute or fixed positioning, a relative or absolute value 
                                that specifies the top, bottom, left, or right position of 
                                an element’s box. For relative positioning, the top, 
                                bottom, left, or right offset of an element’s box.
z-index                     An integer that determines the stack level of an element 
                                whose position property is set to absolute, relative, or fixed.


Possible values for the position property 
static              The element is placed in the normal flow. This is the default.
absolute            The element is removed from the flow and is positioned relative 
                        to the closest containing block that is also positioned. 
                        The position is deter-mined by the top, bottom, left, and 
                        right properties.
fixed               The element is positioned absolutely relative to the browser window. 
                        The position is determined by the top, bottom, left, and 
                        right properties.
relative            The element is positioned relative to its position in the normal 
                        flow. The position is determined by the top, bottom, left, 
                        and right properties                             


Description 
• By default, static positioning is used to position block elements 
    from top to bottom and inline elements from left to right.
• To change the positioning of an element, you can code the position 
    property. In most cases, you also code one or more of the top, 
    bottom, left, and right properties.
• When you use absolute, relative, or fixed positioning for an element, 
    the element can overlap other elements. Then, you can use the z-index 
    property to specify a value that determines the level at which the 
    element is displayed. An element with a higher z-index value is displayed 
    on top of an element with a lower z-index value
