SEO guidelines 
	• Code the description metadata for each page of your website. It should 
		summarize the contents of the page, it should be unique for each page, 
		and it can be longer than the title tag. When it is displayed in the 
		search-engine results, it should encourage users to click on your link.
	• Code the keywords metadata for each page of your website. It should 
		consist of no more than 10 keywords or phrases, and it should be 
		unique for each page.
-->


<!--
Description 
	• The meta element provides information about the HTML document that’s 
		called metadata.
	• The charset metadata is required for HTML5 validation. 
	• All or part of the description metadata may be displayed in the search 
		results of some search engines.
	• Google and Bing ignore the keywords metadata, but Yahoo may still use it.
