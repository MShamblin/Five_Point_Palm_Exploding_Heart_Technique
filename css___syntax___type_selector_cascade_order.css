/* Cascade Order */

/*
The cascade order for applying CSS style rules 
Search for the style rules that apply to an element in the sequence that follows and apply the 
style rule from the first group in which it’s found: 
    • !important declarations in a user style sheet 
    • !important declarations in a web page 
    • Normal declarations in a web page 
    • Normal declarations in a user style sheet 
    • Default declarations in the web browser
*/
/*
If more than one style rule at a cascade level is applied to an element... 
    • Use the style rule with the highest specificity. For example, the p.highlight selector is more 
        specific than the .highlight selector.
    • If the specificity is the same for two or more style rules in a group, use the style rule that’s 
        specified last.
*/

/*
How to determine the specificity of a selector 
    • An id is the most specific. 
    • A class, attribute selector, or pseudo-class selector is less specific. 
    • An element or pseudo-element selector is least specific.

Description 
    • When two or more style rules are applied to an HTML element, CSS uses the cascade order and 
        rules shown above to determine which style rule to apply.
    • A user can create a user style sheet that provides a default set of style rules for web pages. 
        Users with poor vision often do this so the type for a page is displayed in a large font.
    • Since most users don’t create user style sheets, you usually can control the way the style 
        rules are applied for your websites. But you should keep in mind how your web pages could be 
        affected by user style sheets.
    • If you want to create or remove a user style sheet for a browser, you can search the Internet 
        for the procedures that your browser requires.
