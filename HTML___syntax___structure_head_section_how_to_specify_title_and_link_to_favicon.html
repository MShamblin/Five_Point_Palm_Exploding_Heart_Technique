SEO guidelines for the title tag 
    • Always code a title tag in the head section. 
    • The title should accurately describe the page’s content, and it should 
        include the one or two keywords, called focus keywords, that you want 
        to be used to rank the page.
    • The title should be interesting enough to entice the reader to click on 
        it when it’s shown in the search results for a search engine.
    • The title should be unique for each page in your website. 
    • Limit the length of your titles to around 65 characters because most 
        search engines don’t display more than that in their results.

Description 
    • The title element specifies the text that’s displayed in the browser’s 
        tab for the web page.
    • The title is also used as the name of a favorite or bookmark for the page. 
    • A custom icon, called a favicon, is typically named favicon.ico. A favicon 
        typically appears to the left of the title in the browser’s tab for the 
        page. It may also appear to the left of the URL in the browser’s address 
        bar, and it may be used in a favorite or bookmark.
    • To specify a favicon for a page, you can use a link tag exactly like the 
        one shown above.
    • When you deploy a website to a web server, you can omit the link element 
        for the favicon if you place the favicon in the root folder for the website.
    • To create an ico file, you can use an icon editor, a program that converts 
        an image to an ico file, or a web-based converter. You may also be able 
        to find an icon on the Internet by searching for “web icons”.
