/*
A meta element that sets viewport properties 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
*/

/*    
Description 
    • The viewport on a mobile device determines the content that’s displayed on the screen. It can be larger 
        or smaller than the actual visible area of the screen.
    • You use a meta element to control the viewport settings for a device. You add this element within the 
        head element of a page.
    • When you use media queries, you should set the width property of the content attribute to “device-width”, 
        and you should set the initial-scale property to 1. You can also prevent or limit scaling with the 
        user-scalable, minimum-scale, and maximum-scale properties.
