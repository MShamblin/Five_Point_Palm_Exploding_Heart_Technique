/*Properties for wrapping and aligning wrapped flex items 

flex-wrap       Determines how flex items wrap if there is not enough room 
                    for them within the flex container. Possible values are 
                    nowrap, wrap, and wrap-reverse. The default is nowrap.
align-content   Determines how lines of flex items are aligned within the 
                    flex container. Possible values include stretch, 
                    center, flex-start, flex-end, space-between, and 
                    space-around. The default is stretch.
flex-flow       The shorthand property for setting flex-direction and 
                    flex-wrap. 

The flex-flow property in this table is a shorthand property that can be used
to set the flex-direction property and the flex-wrap property at the same time. 
For instance, this CSS rule */

    flex-flow: column wrap;

/*sets the flex-direction property to column and the flex-wrap property to wrap.


Description 
• By default, flex items are not wrapped within a flex container. 
    This causes the contents of flex items that are set to specific widths 
    to wrap within the item or to get cut off.
• By default, wrapped flex items extend from the top to the bottom of the 
    flex container. You can change this vertical alignment using the 
    align-content property.
