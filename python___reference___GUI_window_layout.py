Types of Window Components and Their Attributes
GUI programs use several types of window components, or widgets as they are commonly called. These include labels, 
entry fields, text areas, command buttons, drop-down menus, sliding scales, scrolling list boxes, canvases, and many 
others. The breezypythongui module includes methods for adding each type of window component to a window. Each 
such method uses the form:

seld.addComponentType(<arguments>)

When this method is called, breeypythongui
    Creates an instance of the requested type of window component
    Initializes the componentâ€™s attributes with default values or any values provided by the programmer
    Places the component in its grid position (the row and column are required arguments)
    Returns a reference to the component

The window components supported by breezypythongui are either of the standard tkinter types, such as Label , 
Button , and Scale , or subclasses thereof, such as FloatField , TextArea , and EasyCanvas . A complete 
list is shown in Table 8-2. Parent classes are shown in parentheses.
