/* position: absolute; /*
/* An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative 
to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned 
relative to the viewport, like fixed). */

/* However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned 
ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. */

/* Note: A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static. */
