/*
The properties for setting the background color and image 
background 				Background color, image, repeat, attachment, and position values.
background-color 		A color value or keyword that specifies the color of an element’s 
							background. You can also specify the transparent keyword if 
							you want elements behind the element to be visible. This is 
							the default.
background-image 		A relative or absolute URL that points to the image. You can also 
							specify the keyword none if you don’t want to display an image. 
							This is the default.
background-repeat		A keyword that specifies if and how an image is repeated. Possible 
							values are repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, and no-repeat. The 
							default is repeat, which causes the image to be repeated both 
							horizontally and vertically to fill the background.
background-attachment 	A keyword that specifies whether an image scrolls with the document 
							or remains in a fixed position. Possible values are scroll and 
							fixed. The default is scroll.
background-position		One or two relative or absolute values or keywords that specify the 
							initial horizontal and vertical positions of an image. Keywords 
							are left, center, and right; top, center, and bottom. If a vertical 
							position isn’t specified, center is the default. If no position 
							is specified, the default is to place the image at the top-left 
							corner of the element.
