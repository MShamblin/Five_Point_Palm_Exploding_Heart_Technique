Description 
	• When you use the object element, you can control the appearance and operation of the media player by coding parameter elements. These elements are standard HTML.
	• If you don’t specify the MIME type for a file, the file will be opened in the brows-er’s default media player for the media type.
	• Because different players accept different parameters, you typically specify the parameters for all the players you want to provide for. Then, if a player doesn’t support a parameter, it will ignore it.
	• If you don’t want to display the interface for a media player, you can omit the width and height attributes or set them to 0.
	• Some browsers require a param element that specifies the URL of the file even if the file is identified in the object element.
	• The object element is rarely used today thanks in large part to the video and audio elements in HTML5.
