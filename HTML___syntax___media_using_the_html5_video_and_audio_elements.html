Common attributes for the audio and video elements 
Attribute               Description 
src                     The URL of the file to be played. 
poster                  Supported only by the video element, this attribute provides the path to a 
                            static image to be displayed in place of the video file before it is played.
preload                 One of three possible values that tell the browser whether to preload any data: 
                            none (the default), metadata (only preload metadata like dimensions and 
                            track list), or auto (preload the entire media file)
autoplay                Starts playing the media as soon as the web page is loaded in the browser.                         
loop                    Causes the media to repeat playing when it reaches the end.               
muted                   Supported only by the video element, this attribute causes the video to begin 
                            playing (if autoplay is also coded) with the volume muted.  
controls                Displays the default control toolbar underneath the audio or video being played. 
width                   Specifies the width of the media file to be played within the browser. 
height                  Specifies the height of the media file to be played within the browser.


The attributes for the source element 
Attribute           Description 
src                 The URL of the file to be played. 
type                The optional MIME type of the file to be played, including the codec for video files

Description 
	• The video and audio elements play the various media types natively within a browser. 
	• To play a video on any modern browser, all that’s needed is a src attribute that refers 
        to an MP4 file. To play audio, all that’s needed is a src attribute that refers to an MP3 file.
