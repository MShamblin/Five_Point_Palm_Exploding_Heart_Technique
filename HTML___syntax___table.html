	Common elements for coding tables
	table			Defines a table. The other elements for the table are coded within this element
	tr 				Defines a row.
	th 				Defines a header cell within a row. 
	td				Defines a data cell within a row
-->

<!--
	The elements for coding the header, body, and footer 
	thead 			Groups one or more rows into a table header. 
	tbody			Groups the rows between the header and footer into a table body.
	tfoot			Groups one or more rows into a table footer

	A introduction to tables
	To start, a table consists of one or more rows and columns. You define a table by 
		defining its rows. Then, within each row, you define a cell for each column. 
	Within each row, a table can contain two different kinds of cells. Header cells 
		identify what’s in the columns and rows of a table, and data cells contain the 
		actual data of the table. For example, the three cells in the first row of the 
		table in this figure are header cells that identify the contents of the columns. 
		In contrast, the cells in the next four rows are data cells. The last row starts 
		with a header cell that identifies the contents of the cells in that row. 
	In broad terms, a table starts with a header that can consist of one or more rows. 
		Then, the body of the table presents the data for the table. Last, the footer 
		provides summary data that can consist of one or more rows. For accessibility, 
		a table should also have a caption above or below it that summarizes what’s in 
		the table.

<!--
	How to Create a Table
	To define each row in a table, you use the tr (table row) element. Within each row, 
		you code one th (table header) or td (table data) element for each cell in the 
		row. You can see how this works in the table in this figure. In the last row, n
		ote that the first cell is coded as a th element. That’s because it identifies 
		the data in the last row. 
	By default, the content of a header cell is boldfaced and centered in the cell, 
		and the content of a data cell is left-aligned. Also, the width of the cells 
		is determined by the data they contain, with each cell in a column being as 
		wide as the widest cell.
-->
<!--
	How to add a header and footer
	To code a header, you simply code the rows that make up the header between the 
		opening and closing tags of the thead element. Similarly, you code a footer 
		by coding rows within a tfoot element. And you code a body by coding rows 
		within a tbody element. 
-->





<!--
Description 
	• By default, the width of each column in a table is determined automatically based on its content.
	• By default, the content of a th element is boldfaced and centered, and the content of a td element is left-aligned
-->

<!--
Description 
	• A table consists of rows and columns that intersect at cells. 
	• Cells that contain the data of the table are called data cells. 
	• Cells that identify the data in a column or row are called header cells. 
	• The header for a table can consist of more than one row, and the footer 
		for a table can consist of more than one row.
	• The body of a table, which contains the data, usually consists of two 
		or more rows. 
	• Now that CSS can be used for page layout, you should only use tables for tabular data.
-->

<!--
Description 
	• The thead, tbody, and tfoot elements make it easier to style a table with CSS. 
	• You can code the thead, tbody, and tfoot elements in any sequence and the header 
		will always be displayed first and the footer last.
