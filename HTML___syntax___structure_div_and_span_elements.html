Description 
	• Before HTML5, div elements were used to define divisions within the 
		body of a document. Now, the HTML5 semantic elements are replacing 
		div elements.
	• Before HTML5, span elements were used to identify portions of text 
		that you could apply formatting to. Today, a better practice is to 
		use the elements to identify content and to use CSS to format 
		that content.
