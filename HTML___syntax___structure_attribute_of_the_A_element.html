SEO and accessibility guideline 
    • The content of a link should be text that clearly indicates where the 
        link is going.

Description 
    • The <a> element is an inline element that creates a link that loads 
        another web page. The href attribute of this element identifies the page to be loaded.
    • The text content of a link is underlined by default to indicate that 
        it’s clickable. • If a link hasn’t been visited, it’s displayed in 
        blue. If it has been visited, it’s displayed in purple. You can 
        change these values using CSS.
    • If the mouse hovers over a link, the cursor is changed to a hand 
        with the finger pointed as shown above.
