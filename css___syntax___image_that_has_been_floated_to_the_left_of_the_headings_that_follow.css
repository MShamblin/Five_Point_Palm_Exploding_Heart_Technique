The properties for floating image
float			A keyword that determines how an image is floated. Possible values are left, right, and none. 
					None is the default.
clear 			A keyword that determines if an element that follows a floated element flows into the 
					space left by the floated element. Possible values are left, right, both, and none. None is the default.

Description 
	• To float an image, you use the float property, and to set the margins around it, you use the 
		margin property.
	• In chapters 5 and 6, you’ll learn how to set margins and float elements, but this will give 
		you an idea of how you can use an image in a header.
	• When you float an image to the left, the block elements that follow it fill the space to the 
		right of it. When the elements that follow get past the height of the image and its top and 
		bottom margins, they flow into the space below the element.
	• You can use the clear property to stop an element from flowing into the space alongside a 
		floated element.
	• For now, you can experiment with the size of the image to get the effect that you want, but 
		in the next two chapters you’ll learn the right ways to get the same results.
