<!--
 To merge cells, you use the two attributes of the th and td elements that are summarized in 
    this figure. To merge cells so a cell in a row spans two or more columns, you use the 
    colspan attribute. To merge cells so a cell in a column spans two or more rows, you use 
    the rowspan attribute. The value you use for these attributes indicates the number of 
    cells that will be merged.
