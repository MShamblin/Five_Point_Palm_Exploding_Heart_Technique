/*
Description 
	• By default, the auto-completion feature is on in all modern browsers. 
        That means that the browser will display entry options when the user 
        starts an entry. These options will be based on previous entries 
        for fields with similar names or ids.
	• If the required attribute is coded for a field, the browser checks to 
        see whether the field is empty when the form is submitted. If it is, 
        the browser displays its default error message for the field. But 
        what this message says and how it’s displayed are browser-dependent.
	• To select all the input elements with the required attribute, you can 
        also use the attribute selector shown above.
