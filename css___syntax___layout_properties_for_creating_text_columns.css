/* The primary CSS3 properties for creating text columns 

column-count        The number of columns that the text should be divided into. 
column-gap          The width between the columns. Otherwise, this is set by default.
column-rule         Defines a border between columns.
column-span         With the value “all”, this property can be used to have an 
                        element that’s a child of an element that’s formatted with 
                        columns span all of the columns. Not currently supported by 
                        Firefox.


/*
Description 
• At this writing, Firefox doesn’t support the column-span property. 
• If you want the heading of an article to span the columns, you can code 
    the HTML for the heading before the article. Then, you don’t have to use 
    the column-span property. 
• If the columns are too narrow, an article becomes harder to read.
