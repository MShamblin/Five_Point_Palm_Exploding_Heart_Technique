/* Specifying Grid Track Size UOM and Associated Functions */
A unit of measure for specifying the size of grid tracks 
fr      Represents a fraction of the available space in a grid container. Use this unit 
            when building fluid grid layouts or layouts with a combination of fixed and 
            fluid tracks.



Functions for specifying the size of one or more grid tracks
repeat(repeat, track-list)      Repeats one or more track sizes in the track list. The 
                                    repeat value can be a positive integer or the keywords 
                                    auto-fill or auto-fit. 
minmax(min, max)                The minimum and maximum size for a grid track.

/*
Instead of specifying the number of times that tracks will be repeated by a repeat() function, 
    you can use the auto-fit or auto-fill keywords to determine how many tracks are created. 

When the width of the container can hold more than the number of minimum-width columns, both 
    the auto-fit and the auto-fill keywords display all of the columns in one row. 
    
However, these keywords donâ€™t display them the same way. 

 -->    The auto-fit keyword expands the width of the columns to fit the width of the container. 
 -->    The auto-fill keyword expands the columns until the width of the container is large enough 
            to hold another minimum-width column, and then provides the space for that column.
