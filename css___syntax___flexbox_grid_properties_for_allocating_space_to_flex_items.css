/* Properties for allocating space to flex items */

flex-basis          Indicates the initial length of the flex item. Possible 
                        values include auto and units of measure such as 
                        pixels, ems, or percents. The default is auto, 
                        which means that the length is the same as the width 
                        of the item if the width is set or is determined by 
                        the content if the width isn’t set.
flex-grow           A number that indicates how much a flex item will grow 
                        relative to other flex items in the flex container. 
                        The default is 0, which means that the items don’t 
                        grow.

flex-shrink         A number that indicates how much a flex item will shrink 
                        relative to other flex items in the flex container. 
                        The default is 1, which means that the items don’t 
                        shrink.
flex                The shorthand property used to set the flex-grow, 
                        flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.



Description 
• You can use the flex-basis, flex-grow, and flex-shrink properties 
    to determine the initial lengths of the flex items in a flex container 
    as well as the lengths of the items as the screen size changes.
• The flex-grow and flex-shrink properties don’t specify traditional CSS 
    units of measure like pixels, percents, or ems. Instead, they specify 
    a number that represents a proportion of the available space in a 
    flex container relative to other flex items.
• To set the length of the flex items so their size is the same relative 
    to each other as the size of the screen changes, set the flex-basis 
    property of each item to a relative unit of measure such as percents.
• The flex-grow property is used when there’s more space available within 
    a container than what’s specified by the flex-basis properties for 
    all flex items. Then, you can determine the length of a flex item that 
    uses the flex-grow property by taking the ratio of the flex-grow value 
    to the total flex-grow values for all items, multiplying by the 
    unallocated space, and adding that value to the flex-basis value.
• The flex-shrink property works similarly to the flex-grow property, 
    but it’s used when the flex items occupy more space than what’s 
    available within a container. Then, the ratio of the flex-shrink 
    value for an item to the total flex-shrink values for all items is 
    multiplied by the excess width of the flex items and subtracted from 
    the flex-basis value.
