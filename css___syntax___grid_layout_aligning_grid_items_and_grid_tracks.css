/*How to align grid items and grid tracks


Properties for horizontal alignment 
justify-content         Horizontally aligns grid tracks within a container when the tracks are 
                            less than the overall width of the container. The default is start.
justify-items           Horizontally aligns grid items within a grid area. The default is stretch. 
justify-self            Overrides the grid area’s horizontal alignment for an individual grid item.


Properties for vertical alignment 
align-content           Vertically aligns grid tracks within a container when the tracks are less 
                            than the overall height of the container. The default is start.
align-items             Vertically aligns grid items within a grid area. The default is stretch. 
align-self              Overrides the grid area’s vertical alignment for an individual grid item.


Common values for these properties 
start                   Aligns grid items or grid tracks at the beginning of the container. 
end                     Aligns grid items or grid tracks at the end of the container. 
center                  Aligns grid items or grid tracks in the center of the container.
stretch                 The grid items or grid tracks extend from the start of the container to 
                            the end of the container.
space-between           Allocates space evenly between grid tracks.         
space-around            Allocates space evenly between grid tracks with half-size spaces before 
                            the first grid track and after the last grid track.
space-evenly            Allocates space evenly between grid tracks with full-size spaces before 
                            the first grid track and after the last grid track.

Description 
• You can align the column tracks within a container horizontally, and you can 
    align the row tracks vertically.
• You can also align the grid items within a grid area horizontally and vertically, 
    and you can override a grid area’s horizontal and vertical alignment for individual 
    grid items.
• If you specify stretch for the justify-content property, the grid tracks are stretched 
    so they extend from the left side of the container to the right side of the container. 
    If you specify stretch for the align-content property, the grid tracks are stretched so 
    they extend from the top of the container to the bottom of the container.
