Description 
• The figure element can be used as a container for anything that is used as a figure, like an image or a table.
• The figcaption element can be used within a figure to provide a caption that describes the figure, but it is optional. 
	When coded, it can be anywhere within the figure element.
• By default, the figcaption element is an inline element so you usually need to change that.
