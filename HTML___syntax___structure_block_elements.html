SEO guidelines 
	• Use the heading tags to show the structure and importance of the content 
		on a page. Always use the h1 tag to identify the most important 
		information on the page, and only code a single h1 tag on each page. 
		Then, decrease one level at a time to show subsequent levels of importance.
	• Don’t use heading levels as a way to size text. Instead, use CSS to size 
		the headings.

Description 
	• Block elements are the main building blocks of a website. Each block 
		element begins on a new line.
	• The base font size and the spacing above and below headings and paragraphs 
		are determined by the browser, but you can change these values by 
		using CSS.
