Description 
• To define the rows and columns in a grid, you code one value for each 
    row or column, and you separate the values with spaces. If you use 
    the grid-template property, you code a forward slash (/) between the 
    row and column values.
• If you use the grid-gap property to specify the gutters, you can omit the 
    column gutter if it’s the same as the row gutter.
• By default, the grid items are laid out from left to right and top to bottom.
