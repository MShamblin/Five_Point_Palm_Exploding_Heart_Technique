/* The clearfix Hack  
If a floated element is taller than the containing element, 
it will "overflow" outside of its container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem: */

/* Example */
.clearfix {
    overflow: auto;
  }
  
  /* The overflow: auto clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep 
  control of your margins and padding (else you might see scrollbars). 
  The new, modern clearfix hack however, is safer to use, and the following 
  code is used for most webpages: */
  
  .clearfix::after {
      content: "";
      clear: both;
      display: table;
    }
