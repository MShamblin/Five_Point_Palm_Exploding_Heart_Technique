Description 
    • To code a selector for an element and class, code the element name, a period, and the class name.
    • To code multiple selectors for the same style rule, use commas to separate the selectors.
    • To select all elements with a specific attribute, you can use an attribute selector that consists 
        of the universal selector followed by the attribute name in brackets. You can also omit the 
        universal selector when you code this type of selector.
    • To select elements with a specific attribute, you can use an attribute selector that consists 
        of the element followed by the attribute name within brackets.
    • To select an element with a specific attribute value, you can use an attribute selector that 
        consists of the element followed by the attribute name, an equal sign, and a value within 
        quotation marks.
    • When you’re coding the CSS for an HTML page, you usually don’t need attribute selectors. They’re 
        more useful when you’re using JavaScript.
