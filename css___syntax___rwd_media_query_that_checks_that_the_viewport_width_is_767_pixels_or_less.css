/*
Description 
    • A media query is defined by a CSS3 @media selector. This selector specifies the media type for the 
        query and, for the screen media type, one or more conditional expressions. If all of the conditions 
        are true, the styles within the media query are applied to the page.
    • Each conditional expression can check one of the properties listed above. These properties can also 
        be prefixed with min-or max-.
    • The screen size at which a media query is used to change the appearance of a page can be referred to 
        as a breakpoint.
    • Media queries are supported by all the current versions of all the major desktop browsers. That makes 
        media queries easy to test in those browsers.
    • Media queries are also supported by all the current versions of all mobile browsers. 
    • If you include the only keyword, older browsers that don’t support media queries will check the media 
        type but not the conditional expressions.
