/* Overlapping Elements */
/* When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements. */

/* The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element 
(which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others). */

/* An element can have a positive or negative stack order: */

img {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0px;
    top: 0px;
    z-index: -1;
  }
