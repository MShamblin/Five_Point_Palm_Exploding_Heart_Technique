<!--
Description 
	• The core attributes can be coded for most HTML elements. 
	• ID and class names are case sensitive, should start with a letter, 
		and can include letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, colons, 
		and periods.
	• The lang attribute is typically used to assist screen readers to 
		read content correctly and to provide for searches that are restricted 
		by language.
