margin-top 			A relative or absolute value that defines the space between 
						the top border of an element and the top of the containing 
						block or the bottom of the element above it.

						right border of an element and the right side of the containing
						block or the left side of the element to its right.

						the margins for a box. One value is applied to all four margins.
						Two values are applied to the top and bottom and right and left

/*
Description 
	• If you specify a bottom margin for one element and a top margin for the 
		element that follows in the HTML, the margins are collapsed, which means 
		that only the larger margin is applied.
	• You typically use the “auto” keyword to center an element in its containing 
		block. To do that, you must also specify the width of the element.
	• Because different browsers have different default margins for block elements, 
		you often need to set these margins explicitly.
