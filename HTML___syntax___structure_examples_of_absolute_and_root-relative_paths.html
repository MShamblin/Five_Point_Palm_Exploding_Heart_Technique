Description 
    • When you code an absolute URL, you code the complete URL including the 
        domain name for the site. Absolute URLs let you display pages at other 
        websites.
    • When you code a relative URL, you base it on the current folder, which 
        is the folder that contains the current page.
    • A root-relative path is relative to the root folder of the website. 
        It always starts with a slash. Then, to go down one subfolder, you 
        code the subfolder name and a slash. To go down two subfolders, you 
        code a second subfolder name and another slash. And so on.
    • A document-relative path is relative to the folder the current 
        document is in. Then, to go down one subfolder, you code the subfolder 
        name followed by a slash. To go down two subfolders, you code a second 
        subfolder name followed by another slash. And so on.
    • You can also go up in a document-relative path. To go up one level from 
        the current folder, you code two periods and a slash. To go up two levels, 
        you code two periods and a slash followed by two more periods and a slash. 
        And so on.
