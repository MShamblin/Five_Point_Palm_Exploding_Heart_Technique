/*
Description 
	• The CSS3 for linear gradients lets you create gradients for backgrounds 
		without using images.
	• Today, all of the modern browsers provide some support for linear gradients. 
		Except for Internet Explorer and Edge, though, they implement them with 
		their own prefixes: -webkit-for WebKit browsers like Chrome and Safari, 
		-moz-for Mozilla Firefox, and -o-for Opera. Later, when the final CSS3 
		specification is set, these prefixes will be removed.
	• The first parameter of a linear gradient indicates the direction the 
		gradient will go: “to right” for left to right, “to bottom” for top to 
		bottom, “to left” for right to left, “to top” for bottom to top, and a 
		number of degrees if the gradient should be on an angle.
	• The direction is followed by two or more parameters that consist of a color 
		and a percent. The first percent indicates where the first color should 
		start, the last percent indicates where the last color should end, and 
		the percents in between indicate the points at which one gradient stops 
		and the next one starts.
