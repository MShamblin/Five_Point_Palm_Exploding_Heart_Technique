/*
Description 
	• One standard technique for developing the media queries for a responsive design is 
		to start with the queries for larger devices and then work your way down to smaller 
		devices. 
	• Another standard technique for developing media queries is to develop the design for 
		the smallest mobile devices first and then work your way up to larger devices. 
	• When you use the techniques shown above, each media query inherits the styles that 
		precede it in the style sheet, including styles that are coded outside of media 
		queries. Then, the media queries can override the inherited styles. 
	• You can also code the starting set of styles in a media query. For a desktop-first 
		design, you would code the styles in a media query that specifies a minimum width 
		of 960 pixels. For a mobile-first design, you would code the styles in a media 
		query that specifies a maximum width of 479 pixels.
