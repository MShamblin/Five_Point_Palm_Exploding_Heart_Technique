/* The clear Property */
/* When we use the float property, and we want the next 
element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property. */

/* The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is 
next to a floating element. */

/* 
The clear property can have one of the following values:
none            The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
left            The element is pushed below left floated elements
right           The element is pushed below right floated elements
both            The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
inherit         The element inherits the clear value from its parent
*/

/* When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: 
If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. 
Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will 
appear below it on the web page. */


/*
Example
This example clears the float to the left. Here, it means that the <div2> element 
is pushed below the left floated <div1> element: 
*/


div1 {
  float: left;
}

div2 {
  clear: left;
}
