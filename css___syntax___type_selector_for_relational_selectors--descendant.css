Description
    • When you use relational selectors, you can often avoid the need for id or class attributes. 
    • To select elements only when they are descendants of a higher-level element, use a descendant 
        selector that consists of the higher element, a space, and the descendent element. 
    • To select a sibling element that’s adjacent to another element, use an adjacent sibling 
        selector that consists of the first element, a plus sign (+), and the sibling element. 
    • To select elements only when they are child elements of the parent element, you can use a 
        child selector that consists of the parent element, the greater than sign (>), and the 
        child element. 
    • To select any elements that are siblings to another element, you can use a general sibling 
        selector that consists of the first element, a tilde (~), and the sibling element, but 
        this can only be used by browsers that support CSS3.

/*
 Child elements are at the first level below a parent element. Sibling elements are at the same level. 
    And descendent elements can be one or more levels below a parent element.
