Description 
	• When you use the embed element, you code all parameters as attributes, 
        not as param elements.
	• Although the embed element wasn’t part of the HTML4 specification, this 
        element was supported by all major browsers, and now it is included 
        in the HTML5 specification.
	• Often, an embed element is easier to code and works better than a 
        comparable object element. That’s why the embed element is currently 
        in use on many websites.
	• If you don’t specify the MIME type for a file, the file will be opened 
        in the browser’s default media player for the media format.
	• The embed element provides an easy way to display YouTube videos within 
        your web pages.
	• The HTML specification lists four standard attributes, but other attributes 
        are supported for specific media players.

Note 
	• The embed element for playing an MP3 file shown above won’t work in Firefox 
        if the page that contains it is run from your local computer or from a 
        network server. However, it will work if the page is run from a web 
        server. The same is true of the object element for playing an MP4 file 
        that’s shown in figure 14-6.
